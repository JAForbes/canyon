The code for my website.  Hijacks blog posts from my tumblr, with some light code formatting.

It is not very reusable at the moment, but the code is _so_ simple, that I can configure it to be quite easily.

THe simplicity of the site is the reason I haven't bothered with version control until now.

Feel free to fork.
